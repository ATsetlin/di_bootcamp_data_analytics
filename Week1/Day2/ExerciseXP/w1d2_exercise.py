# Week 1 Day 2 Exercise XP 


# Exercise 1 

# Create a set called my_fav_numbers and populate it with your favorite numbers.

# Concatenate my_fav_numbers and friend_fav_numbers to create a new set called our_fav_numbers.
# Note: Sets are unordered collections, so ensure no duplicate numbers are added.
